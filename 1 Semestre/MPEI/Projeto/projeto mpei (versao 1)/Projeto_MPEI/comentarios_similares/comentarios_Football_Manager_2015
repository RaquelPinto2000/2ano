Comentário 1: Honestly they've had problems this year. CONS: - Horrible goalkeeping - Atrocious defensive positioning - Lackluster finishing - Corner glitches - Cannot win headers - You can 65 shots and still end the game without a goal. - Your opponents only need one shot to score - Key Players gets mad because you sold a player with no potential - Ronaldo and Jese are willing to join Arsenal after I finished 6th in my first AND second season.... can't see that happening in real life .... .... .... and worst of all once I start a game it gets boring really quickly (though that's my problem). PROS: - It's a football game

Comentário 1: Not the best version of this game, but still as adictive as it always has been. The main issue is the amount of injuries players get, even for the slightest of knocks they're out for months. Apart from that, the rest of the game is fine.

Comentário 1: Under no circumstances buy this game, i thought becoming a football manager will cure my life long thirst for football and take few hours out of my life. I was wrong, and i used to be like you, i had friends , life and a job. This game took everything away from me. This game will make you "see" Attributes like "Determination", "Leadership" and "Agression" on real life people. They will start to pop up from 1 to 20 on floating texts around their head. Once you start "seeing" them you cannot unsee them anymore. Hidden attributes off real life people are trickier tho. You need to stalk them for a longer periods time. Valuable months and productivity of my life disaapreared just because I.... have to... play .... just ... one .... more... game.. If you value your life even a bit, stay away from game...

Comentário 1: This is the first football manager game i have put any time into, i tried a few but gave up after about an hour. I love my football and this time round i actually took the time to read a few websites on starting about and what tactics would work for my team. This made the game for me alot more enjoyable since the difficulty curve was a little more forgiving. I have read alot of negative reviews on the game especially the 3d match engine but i feel that the match engine adds to the game and i love watching the matches on extended highlights even if sometimes your defenders will do stupid things ;) Overall if you love your football and are willing to put a few hours into learning the mechanics and a few google searches on how your team plays you will have alot of fun

Comentário 1: Besides traditional sports games and online shooters, this is probably the most time I've spent on a game, let alone a sim where you don't even control the players directly. Simply put, I LOVE this game!! As I said, I've always been a fan of sports games (mainly NHL and FiFA) and while I loved the online competition, I also really liked to manage my team, trade/buy players, arrange your lineup and strategy ect. Heck, I could spend hours just trading players (or trying to anyways), resigning them, scouting out potential new additions and whatnot. Thru all this, believe it or not, I'd never heard of FM (in my defense, I'd been playing exclusively on consoles for the last 6-7 years) So when I found Football Manager, a game that is precisely about the management aspect of the team, I jumped on the bandwagon and boy am I glad I did. I love how much control it gives you over a team. I mean, contracts, training, transfers, tactics, name it, its there, and in great detail. Contracts have a bunch of clauses this canadian had never hear of, tranfers are not as easy and simple as you'd think sometimes, and tactics can be tweaked/adjusted to your heart's content! There aren't many things more satisfying than taking a lower league team and, with careful management and ambitious transfers, turning them into a top flight powerhouse who challenges for the league and Champion's Cup year after year! One of the downsides tho, is that when you do manage to raise a lower league club to glory, it seems the chaiman and/or board don't ajdust their mentalities quite accordingly. Therefore, I've won the BPL twice in a row with Fulham now, coupled with a Champions League trophy and various Cups/Shields etc. and I'm still making around 45-50k a year and the board doesn't want to expand our new stadium (3 yrs old) of 36.5k capacity even though attendance is through the roof and the club are raking in decent profits and are atop the club value table. Another le is the sim engine, who will sometimes decide to decimate your team with injuries, which isn't as bad as early on, thanks to updates, but I did have to use up all my subs in the first half once because three players went down. I mean SERIOUSLY?!?? And they were all in the 90% fitness range too boot. It will also make your players miss an absurd amount of scoring chances, with the very occasional highlight reel strike from 30 yards strike and exremely rare bicycle kick going in. Other than that, nothing significant really brings down this gem of a game. Couple it with a decent face/logo pack to make it look more realistic, and the FM Editor and a custom skin amidst the vast array of choices for a truly customized experience and you'll be all set for countless hours of fun!

But the negative side of this game is that it does not have enough online players willing to play online, it is more fun if you play it with friends!

Overall, I have to say that Football Manager 2015 is a massive improvement from its 2014 counterpart and would highly recommend it to all Football fanatics. If you are a past FM player and have been dissapointed with past versions, i honestly BEG you to revisit your perspective and try out FM15 (Please..)! It is a big step up from 2014 and is worth the money. 9/10

Comentário 1: Still the best football simulator game.. After I missed the 2014 series, this 2015 series is a much improvement from 2013 series.. The most improved part is: (1) higher complexity in handling players' contracts and negotiation with other clubs; as well as (2) the improved tactical variety (player's role, etc). While this could be a little bit cumbersome for those who new to this series, I believe the built-in tutorial will be very useful.

Comentário 1: Keepers seem to be really slow at reacting and bad back passes are a reoccurring theme! But overall a solid game.

Comentário 1: The game is quite good. Some new features but why you change things without a reason. Just to change something. What I don't like? 1) Tactics screen. These drop down boxes. Really bad idea. Chaos. 2) New skin and colors. FM2014 had a good skin and colors. Improved from version FM2013. If something is good don't change it just to add something new. 3) I don't use 3D engine but it looks fine. However players still swim or fly on a pitch. Animations still really poor. To SI If you could change these tact screen and add a new skin and normal colors would be great. One more thing SI. I think that after all these years you could get more licences hyyy? If EA can what's the problem? Still worth to buy.

Comentário 1: I was always a bit nervous about the releasing of a new version of this game. I've played all of these since 2010, but the last two versions of the game were pretty disappointing (always best soccer/football management games on the market, though). And, I'm pretty happy to say that this year the game is good, also at the current update! It have a nicer design, is more realistic, they have improved the player market (still, more work should be done on this) and the game is faster to sim! I always liked sim games, but I think the BETTER game by SI was EHM 2007. This because it was funny, great (still best hockey sim/management game on the market!) and REALLY FAST. I don't really understand why they give you all the rosters, teams and championships of the world, if you cannot select more than 10-15 of them (with the rest of the world that remain "silence": no players, no offer for your players...). What I really miss is an option to FAST simulate championships as EHM 2007 give you as an option. I prefer to lost a little (and also more) of info, but be able to sim a World! However, this year the game as improved much in this sense. You still have to be able to play on a nice system, but I'm currently sim all the default teams, excepts from Asia, with a small Database, and the game seems "smooth". I don't know if can be worth to add Asia and Mods for new championships, as the game suffer from a great "deterioration" of sim's speed if you play with more of 120000 players (140000 are still good). Really recommended.

Comentário 1: Over 200 hours into FM 2015 and more than 1000 of hours in it's predecessors I find myself surrounded by over 50 football shirts of obscure teams I managed on the game. My degree has been delayed for two years now, but I am 17 matches unbeaten in New Caledonia.

Comentário 1: I am playing the series since 1997, so i have a clear view of the game proggression through the years. Although i just bought my copy i can say that there are some really interesting changes like scouting reports the new 3D etc. It's a great game as you always expect from SI. Sure there are some things that can be fixed with patches. But i have to admit i am also worried about the injuries. In my first game month, my team already has 6 injuries and all of them are 6 weeks+. IF that is some kind of bug (and not just bad reallistic luck) then i am sure it will be fixed in the next few weeks with a patch or update.

Comentário 1: Football Manager, needs strong rivals, just like a serious football team. While the FM isn't the most innovative and most impressive game around, it's still the best football management title. 8/10 would recommend.

Comentário 1: It's good. Everyone complaining that it's the same game, that's the case every year. I don't know why some people want or expect an entirely different game, personally I would be upset if they drastically changed things. Pros: -New and improved graphics and animations -Requires real tactical planning, simply throwing top players out there without careful strategic planning will result in losses -Improved, more streamlined interface (except for the tactics screen for some reason they made it worse and you have to click more stuff) -Improved scouting and player potential system -Improved training options -It's M F ing football manager Cons: -Tactics screen is worse now -Some early bugs (will be fixed in the coming months most likely) -Too many goals are scored from set pieces -Some wonky things with the match engine, players kick balls directly in to players in front of them way too often, and the ball will ping-pong off of players randomly too much in the box

Comentário 1: I have absolutely no regret for buying this game! Although it is quite difficult to start with for some people, it takes considerable time to delve deeply enough into this game before you can get the hang of it BUT THE REWARDS ARE FAR MORE THAN YOU CAN EXPECT! As for me I totally love this game and I would encourage every football fan to try it and give it a fair shot. You won't be disappointed in most cases!

Comentário 1: Latest release of Football Manager, have to say have really been enjoying it, well adapted to let you to control as much or as little of the team as required. New developments such as having areas that you are a appraised on as a manager are minor tweaks to the game on the surface but all put together they make some major changes. Also the game play when watching seems more realistic and believable than previous versions.

Comentário 1: So I really hated this game at the beginning when it was a beta, there were many errors, was less realistic than the FM14, goals would be scored easily for or against you, players mentality was very bad and weak that there were 4+ goal comebacks everywhere, however, after they fixed all that the game is AWESOME now like always, it's amazing, a realistic life experience for your dream job, with the new feature now you feel more in control of your team, how you communicate with your players and media, and of course the new amazing feature of setting your style of coaching and what kind of a football manager you are which I find just BRILLIANT, and the studying for licenses as well.... I could go on and on for days, but I won't because there is a new season about to start, so get this game.. put on your suit.. and get busy.

Comentário 1: Ive played these games since the champ man days, this has to be the worst version! The AI of the game is unreal, you have players hitting the post countless times in a match, conceeding goals within 20 seconds and injury lists as long as your arm. These are all part of the game in real life you may say, i agree, not like the kind you see in this game. You can be barcelona and be a goal down within 20 seconds with messi hitting the post every 2 minutes ( "it beats the keeper!! the keeper gathers the ball)
